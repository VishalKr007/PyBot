# PyBot

   PyBot is a simple python -Telegram bot. I built it on Python and using `Telegram API` for bot.
   
   In pybot, It has Bots that would do different simple works. like :
1. [timerbot.py](https://github.com/VishalKr007/PyBot/blob/master/Bots/timerbot.py) - It works like alarm to give reminder when users         set a specific time and bot will beeps after reaching given time.

2. [echobot.py](https://github.com/VishalKr007/PyBot/blob/master/Bots/echobot.py) - It echoes all the text that the users sends to bot.

3. [Capbot.py](https://github.com/VishalKr007/PyBot/blob/master/Bots/Capbot.py) - It returns all the message after capitalize the words      that a users sends to bot
